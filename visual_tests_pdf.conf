# Visual regression test configuration
#
# Per-sample threshold overrides for non-deterministic samples.
# Format: filename threshold
#
# threshold is the max allowed pixel difference percentage:
#   100    = render-only check (any pixel diff is OK, just verify it produces output)
#   0-99   = allow up to that percentage of pixel difference
#
# Examples:
#   random_dither.ps  100    # Fully random output, just check it renders
#   partial_random.ps 25     # Partially random, allow up to 25% diff
